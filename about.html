                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <p>The Association of Aeronautical Engineers (AAE) is the official student body of the Department of Aerospace Engineering at Madras Institute of Technology (MIT), Anna University. Established in 1953, AAE is one of the oldest and most vibrant student-led organizations in the institution, carrying a legacy of over seven decades.
AAE functions as a completely student-driven organization, run by students, for students. From conceptualization to execution, responsibilities such as event management, finance handling, public relations, technical activities, workshops, and serving as resource persons are independently managed by the members. This self-governed structure empowers and upskills students in aeronautics while deepening subject knowledge and strengthening leadership, teamwork, management, and social skills. AAE serves as a platform where students develop confidence, responsibility, and professionalism, preparing them to excel in the aeronautical industry and beyond.
